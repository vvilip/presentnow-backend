# PresentNow Backend

**PresentNow** is an open-source backend REST API (built with Java + Quarkus) for a web application that helps people collaboratively organize and manage gift-giving for occasions like birthdays.

## Project Idea

Finding the right present for someone can be challenging. PresentNow aims to make gift-giving easier for everyone involved:

- **Person A (Recipient)** creates or shares a wish list of presents.
- **Friends of A** can view the list, choose what they want to buy, and reserve presents to avoid duplicates.
- Friends can see who is buying which present, but Person A cannot see who is buying whatâ€”preserving the surprise!

## Features

- REST API built on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) (Java)
- User and present management
- Present suggestion and reservation system
- Privacy: Only friends see who is buying which present; the recipient cannot
- Designed for easy integration with frontend clients

## Tech Stack
